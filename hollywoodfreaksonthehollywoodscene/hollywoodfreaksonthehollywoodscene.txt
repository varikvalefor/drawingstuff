Let there exist a man $J$.
$K$ denotes the depicted man.
In the middle of an arbitrary night, as $J$ walks down an arbitrary street and nears a power substation, $K$ appears from behind a bush and slowly approaches $J$.
Whilst $J$ appears rather surprised and unnerved, $K$ opens $K$'s coat and speaks the following words: "Hey, kid... want some free software?"
Determining whether or not $J$ "takes up" $K$'s offer is left as an exercise for the reader.

Another dumb joke is revealed!  In this case, the joke takes the form of a drawing which is called "HOLLYWOODFREAKSONTHEHOLLYWOODSCENE".

In addition to being a dumb joke, this drawing is VARIK's first _real_ attempt to draw fabric.

The "7.0" disc is an OpenBSD installation disc, and the "13" disc is a FreeBSD installation disc.  As of the publishing of this drawing, 7.0 and 13.0 are the most recent versions of OpenBSD and FreeBSD, respectively.
The reader can assume that the contents of the pockets of the coat are specifications and compilers of the programming languages whose "logos" are mentioned.  "[L]ogos" is written in inverted commas because one such "logo" is not an established logo but is a recognisable feature of the programming language which this "logo" represents.
Whilst conceptualising this drawing, VARIK intends to mention a relatively great number of softwares.  However, there exists an idea such that this idea does not immediately come to fruition.  A "deluxe" version of this drawing may eventually be created.

As ever, criticism regarding this drawing is appreciated.

This drawing is drawn using GIMP.
